<h2>What is the Blindcraft and how did it start?</h2>
<p>
    The Blindcraft server is a Survival SMP (survival multiplayer) server that started 3 years ago as LogicProGamings first survival map. It was uploaded to realms 2 months later after his other blind friends and some subscribers wanted to play. The server then transferred to its current home in January 2021. The Minecraft version is 1.16.5.
