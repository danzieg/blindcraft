<h4>
How long have you played Minecraft for?
</h4>
<p>I have been playing Minecraft for about 3 and a half years now.</p>
<h4>
Any information that the community should know about you? 
</h4>
<p>I have a lot of hobbies outside of Minecraft.  I enjoy making custom keyboards, mixing and making music, walking with my dogs, and learning to edit videos.</p>
<h4>
What is your favourite block in Minecraft? 
</h4>
<p>Most likely smooth stone.  white concrete would be second I just love the way they contrast with nearly everything else.  I just would not use it in a snow biome lol.</p>
<h4>
What visual changes do you use?  
</h4>
<p>I use a few texture packs.  One is easy blocks because it smooths out a lot of textures and helps with block separations.  The next is Dark mode that gives the menus and HUD a lot mor contrast with the text and items.  the last is ore highlighter.  This texture pack puts a boarder around the ore block that is the same colour as the ore so when it is uncovered while mining or in the nether it is easier to notice.</p>
<h4>
Do you use any mods? 
</h4>
<p>I use a few mods.  Accessibility plus, accessibility plus extended, easy life, and Item Stack Zoom.  These mods extend text to speech and keyboard navigation into the game as well as helps provide the player with context in the world.  Item stack zoom helps blow up the items I have selected so I can really get a good look at a block when I am choosing building materials, or if I am not sure what something in my hot bar is.</p>
<h4>
Do you use any shaders?
</h4>
<p>I only use the Nostalgia shaders on stream because they do not change too much and they look nice.  I cannot use super realistic shaders because that is not how I see the world in real life so all the flairs from the sun and block coloration and higher reflections and stuff I do not really notice. in real life.  it is just too much information. I like it simple like Minecraft itself.</p>
